How to solve almost any graphs problem

1. Describe the problem using graph terminology
-- What are your nodes?
-- What are your edges? When are two nodes connected to each other?
-- Are there connected components?

2. Build your graph OR define a get_neighbors function

3. Choose your graph algorithm(bft, dft, bfs, dfs, recursion), and run 

Given two words (begin_word and end_word), and a dictionary's word list, return the shortest transformation sequence from begin_word to end_word, such that:
Only one letter can be changed at a time.
Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that begin_word is not a transformed word.

Example:
start_word = "hit"
end_word = "cog"
return: ['hit', 'hot', 'cot', 'cog']

for these list of words:
